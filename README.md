# StackEdit (fork)

> Full-featured, open-source Markdown editor based on Markdown-it.

This is a fork of stackedit.io, with a number of pull requtests applied,
dependencies updated to fix security issues, and general cleanups. There is no
publically hosted version of this fork.

I am not a frontend person, nor do I do a lot of javascript. I'm basically
maintaining a tool that I personally find useful for myself. Patches and Issues
are welcome, and I will do my best to address them as time allows.

### Build

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm start

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
